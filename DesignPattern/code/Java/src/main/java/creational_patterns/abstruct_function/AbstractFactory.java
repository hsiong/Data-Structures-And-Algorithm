 * Class MazeFactory can create components of mazes. It builds rooms, walls, and doors
 * between rooms. It might be used by a program that reads plans for mazes from a
 * file and builds the corresponding maze. Or it might be used by a program that
 * builds mazes randomly. Programs that build mazes take a MazeFactory as an argument
 * so that the programmer can specify the classes of rooms, walls, and doors to
 * construct.
